KERN_DIR=/usr/src/kernels/`uname -r`

## Current running kernel on CentOS 5 and Red Hat (RHEL) 5 ##
KERN_DIR=/usr/src/kernels/`uname -r`-`uname -m`

## Fedora example ##
KERN_DIR=/usr/src/kernels/4.15.6-300.fc27.x86_64/build

## CentOS and Red Hat (RHEL) example ##
KERN_DIR=/usr/src/kernels/3.10.0-693.17.1.el7-x86_64/build
